                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>Hello, my name is Jorge. I studied Game Design and Development with an emphasis on 3D Models - I
                        haven't touched it in a long time,<span class="link"> <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/sulfonicxeno/gallery/">but
                        here's some work if you'd like to see.</a></span>. For the past 5 years I have been working as a
                        marketing assistant dealing with all digital facets for Neutronics Inc. I became interested in
                        web development after having to delve into it for the company. We used the wordpress platform
                        with the Divi plugin - this was a blessing and a curse as modifying anything against their
                        template would require having to deep dive into child themes, php, and css. This helped me
                        understand the concept of what web development is and what it takes. Frustration and all, I
                        enjoyed the whole process.</p>
